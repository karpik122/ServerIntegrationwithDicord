# Server Integration with Dicord
This plugin is designed to make the administration's work more pleasant and efficient by sending reports to a selected discord channel.
- Logs of commands used by players (in addition to /login, /register, /changepassword etc.).
It also offers a plugin to check how much time players have spent on the server

 

 

The plugin at this stage of development only offers 2 languages Polish and English.

Changing the language can be done in the configuration file in the "language:" line.

 

In the config.yml file.
Please enter the TKOEN of your discord bot and paste in the ID of the channel you want the logs and reports on.
